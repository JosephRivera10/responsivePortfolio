      <img src="assets/images/ME.png" class="auth-image" alt="Joseph Rivera">

      <p>I started out as an IT recruiter who got way more obsessed about talking to people about what they were doing than trying to hire them. I fell in love with the culture and the people in IT. I was also amazed by what they could work on and do with their knowledge.</p>

      <p>I used that passion to drive into the field. Now I have the knowledge and capabilities to perform front-end and back-end functions in web development. I always look to improve my skills by working with great teams, and always looking for the next best tech.</p>
